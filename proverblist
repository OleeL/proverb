A picture is worth a thousand words
A stitch in time saves nine
Actions speak louder than words
All that glitters is not gold
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Every cloud has a silver lining
Honesty is the best policy
The early bird catches the worm
The pen is mightier than the sword
Too many cooks spoil the broth
When in Rome do as the Romans do
